power rolls are a 3 tiered system. they have the following static tiers: <11, 12-16, 17+ and in rare cases 19-20. each tier has its own text and could include:

- damage
- hero characteristic score
- condition
- potency

all of which should be calculated based on the hero stats and be updated dynamically as the hero changes
