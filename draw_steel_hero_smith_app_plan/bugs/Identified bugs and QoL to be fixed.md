## easy

project points from background should be availavable?

the notifications of saving and or the random displays that pop out of the bottom must be removed upon release

need to add an icon.

when clicking any field that accepts values in the creator the ap should not defopult to typing in the field

the starting chars should remember theri values if the class is unchanged

cannot save the word of guidance in the features panel

features that require a choise need to be noted

second option in the equip and mod still does not persist

save end benefits form a lower score - colors should be reversed

add a click function to the surges to spend them and remove the total

potency needs to be shown in the sheet

recoveries must better show their value

the A in kits sometimes is not colored properly

hero starting disengage should be 1


## medium

growing ferocity tabels are not implemented

need to add a loading screen noting that this is not an official product and is working on their rules.

some treasure have abilities that need to be added

when changing class the app should make sure to override the previous values

most popouts should be wider

abilities cards inside should strech the whole width, example: kits

add an item page to gear

titles must grant their abilities

must add storwight abilites

must add treasure abilities

a page in gear that shows the kits that the hero has favourited and lets them swap

## hard

on my phone some elements do not update on time

the storing of equasion and calculation must be applied accross the board. not just the woadwalker recovery bonus

## need testing

ancestry traits should have their longer text displayed and if its too cluttered have to display fixed - may not have it in the db - it is missing take it from forge steel

abilities should show all abilities that the hero gains including ones gained by class or a feature ex: judgment, my life for yours and etc. - i think is fixed

treasures that are already in the gear of a hero should not be removed when i try to add them by the downtime project - i think its fixed
