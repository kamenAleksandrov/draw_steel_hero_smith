ancestry traits should have their longer text displayed and if its too cluttered have to display fixed - may not have it in the db

complications and other traits should have the implemented feature to grant items example - Betrothed

add an add ability to the abilities page

the abilities display uses regex and colors the A and a in text wrongfully

abilities should show all abilities that the hero gains including ones gained by class or a feature ex: judgment, my life for yours and etc. - i think is fixed

i don't think all skills and languages are being properly saved

i need to add notes page to the hero

the notifications of saving and or the random displays that pop out of the bottom must be removed upon release

maybe add treasures that have downtime projects stats to the downtime projects

the select a kit button in the creator should take the whoel row

events link is missing form downtime and project points from background should be availavable

the abilities are loaded 3 times each in the db or just the display, this is bad.

the heading of the codex pages should be removed and keep only the navigation name at the top

growing ferocity tabels are not implemented

need to add a loading screen noting that this is not an official product and is working on their rules.

hero cards have small question marks, the display needs fixing

perks in codex should display the abilities they grant

kits do not swap for wads, ench end else in the sheet

in the abilities page i should probably have a navigation tab going to kits disply as there ins enough space

need to add an icon.
