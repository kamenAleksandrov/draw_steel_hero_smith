ancestry traits should have their longer text displayed and if its too cluttered have to display fixed - may not have it in the db

abilities should show all abilities that the hero gains including ones gained by class or a feature ex: judgment, my life for yours and etc. - i think is fixed

complications and other traits should have the implemented feature to grant items example - Betrothed

perks in codex should display the abilities they grant

project points from background should be availavable?

the heading of the codex pages should be removed and keep only the navigation name at the top

growing ferocity tabels are not implemented

i don't think all skills and languages are being properly saved

the notifications of saving and or the random displays that pop out of the bottom must be removed upon release
