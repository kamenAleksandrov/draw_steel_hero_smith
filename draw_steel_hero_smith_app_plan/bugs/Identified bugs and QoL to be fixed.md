ancestry traits should have their longer text displayed and if its too cluttered have to display fixed - may not have it in the db

complications and other traits should have the implemented feature to grant items example - Betrothed

add an add ability to the abilities page

the abilities display uses regex and colors the A and a in text wrongfully

abilities should show all abilities that the hero gains including ones gained by class or a feature ex: judgment, my life for yours and etc. - i think is fixed

i don't think all skills and languages are being properly saved

i need to add notes page to the hero

the notifications of saving and or the random displays that pop out of the bottom must be removed upon release
