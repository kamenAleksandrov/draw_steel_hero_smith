it has a display for health that can be increased and decreased similar to the [[increase_decrease_counter_widget]]. the widget changes colors based on the hp value if healthy, winded or dying.

there are displays for max stamina, winded value and dying range (0 - (the negative winded value))

next to the editable value there is an input for taking damage, healing or getting temp hp.
when getting damaged the temp stamina is reduced first. 

when gaining temp stamina the value is evaluated with the current temp stamina and the highest of them is taken and applied, they don't add up.

additional functionates are recoveries they may be additional widget but they need to edit stamina so I'm not entirely sure.
