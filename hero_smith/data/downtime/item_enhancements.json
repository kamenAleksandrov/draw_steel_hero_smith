    "description": "Windcutting: Whenever you use a melee signature ability that usually targets one creature, you can take a bane on the ability to target each enemy in a cube 3 within distance. If your signature ability would usually cause one target to become grabbed or restrained, each target in the area is instead slowed until the end of their next turn."
