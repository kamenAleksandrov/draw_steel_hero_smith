You and any creatures you designate can operate the ship by touching the ship's wheel. During combat, a creature touching the wheel can maneuver to make the ship move up to 10 squares. The ship can be moved only once per round. Out of combat, the ship has a speed of 130 miles per day.\n\nAn airship is an object (giving it damage immunity all to poison and psychic damage) and can take 200 damage before it is destroyed. If the damage the ship takes is not too severe (as the Director determines), as long as you have access to materials that can repair the ship, you can restore it back to its original condition as a respite activity."

You can undertake several Community Service projects at the same time, but each one must be in a different community.\n\nWhile undertaking this project, you provide help to people in need, doing odd jobs, tutoring life skills, cleaning streets or public spaces, finding lost valuables, and the like. The Director determines the characteristic that applies to the project roll based on the activities you undertake. When you complete this project, you receive a random consumable treasure of the Director's choice from someone in the community as thanks for your hard work."

The Director determines the specific catch, which might include food, alchemical ingredients, or even small treasures found in the fish."
