If the target doesn't have space to grow, they grow as much as they can and become restrained until the effect ends.\n- They have fire immunity 10.\n- Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason score.\n- When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced movement distance gains a +2 bonus.\n- They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for Might power rolls.",
