Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven tactics, you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill.

(This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.)\nFor example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:\n- Stamina Bonus: +12 per echelon\n- Stability Bonus: +1\n- Melee Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2\n- Ranged Damage Bonus: +0/+0/+4\n- Speed Bonus: +1\n- Ranged Distance Bonus: +10\n- Disengage Bonus: +1\n- You can use the Patient Shot and Protective Attack signature abilities.\nKit signature abilities have their kit's bonuses already applied, which might require you to adjust the bonuses of the signature abilities you gain from a kit. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to 3/6/9.
