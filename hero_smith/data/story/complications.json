The demon acts first in the combat, regardless of the traits or abilities of you or any other creature involved.\né You learn nothing and your time is wasted.\ní You learn one bonus heroic ability from your class that you qualify for.

You turn into this animal when it’s convenient—and sometimes when it’s inconvenient as well.\nBenefit: As a maneuver, you take the form of a specific animal of size 1T. You retain all your other statistics aside from your size, but you can’t talk or use actions, and the only maneuvers you can use are Escape Grab, Hide, and Stand Up. Based on the animal you can turn into, you might be able to burrow or fly, or to automatically climb or swim at full speed while moving.

You’ve made too many enemies on the other side.\nBenefit: You have 3 antihero tokens. Whenever you use an ability or other effect that costs your Heroic Resource, you can spend 1 antihero token in place of 1 Heroic Resource. Whenever you have fewer than 3 antihero tokens and you would earn a hero token for your party through your deeds, you instead regain 1 antihero token.\nDrawback: While you have fewer than 3 antihero tokens, you exude a villainous aspect.

    "description": "You travel with a giant hawk who you stole from the Hawklords. You might once have been a Hawklord yourself, or perhaps you escaped their captivity. Having a giant hawk companion comes with its share of inconveniences and dangers, but those are a small price to pay for the freedom of the open sky.\nBenefit: As long as you are not in a building or other structure, you can spend 1 uninterrupted minute to summon your giant hawk, which acts as your mount. You can dismiss the hawk at any time (no action required). The hawk won’t go inside buildings, dungeons, or other structures, and it won’t accept anyone but you as a rider. If the hawk takes damage or dies, you can restore them to full Stamina as a respite activity.\nDrawback: People aware of the origin of your mount are afraid to interact with you, since they worry the Hawklords will come after them by association. You take a bane on any test made to influence anyone who knows of the Hawklords and who has observed you with your giant hawk. Such people might also report you to the Hawklords, who come looking for you at the Director’s discretion."

This body was dead when we found it, and we merely gave it another chance at life. We are friendly. Please put down those torches!”\nBenefit: You are a sapient fungus who inhabits a humanoid body. Your host body follows all the usual rules for a character and is considered to be alive. At any time while your host body is alive, or for 24 hours after it dies, you can use a main action to move to a dead humanoid within 10 squares of the body and use it as your new host body, provided the body belongs to a playable ancestry. When you do so, your original host body dies if it was alive. Your new host body gains all your statistics except size, ancestry traits, and other statistics related to your former host body’s ancestry, which you instead gain from your new host body. When you inhabit a new host body, you start with 1 Stamina and can immediately spend a Recovery.\nDrawback: You have fire weakness 5.

Additionally, whenever one or more creatures are pursuing you, you can lay low as a respite activity. When you do so, anyone pursuing you loses track of your and your party’s location and must start their search again.\nDrawback: Each time you earn Renown, your pursuer learns your location. Unless you lay low or move to a new location, you’ll be visited by agents of the pursuer within 1d10 days. If you linger after that, your pursuer finds you."

    "description": "You were tasked with delivering a ceremonial shield to your older sibling, a celebrated warrior, for their years of service. When you arrived at their homestead, you found them dead on their doorstep with their own sword lodged in their back. To find out who did this to them—and why—you decided to step into their shoes. It will take a while to match up to your sibling’s legacy, though.\nBenefit: While you wear your sibling’s shield on your back, you can’t be flanked.\nDrawback: Visions of your dead sibling haunt you at night. Whenever you take a respite, make an Intuition test that can’t make use of any skill. On a tier 1 or tier 2 outcome, you regain 1 fewer Recoveries than usual when you finish the respite."

    "name": "Silent Sentinel",
    "description": "You were trained by a group of spies, who psionically infused silence into your every step and enhanced your ability to hear distant whispers. But your enhanced hearing has some nasty side effects.\nBenefit: You have the Eavesdrop and Sneak skills from the intrigue skill group, plus one skill of your choice from the lore skill group. Additionally, you can telepathically communicate with any creature provided they share a language with you and you can observe each other. A creature you communicate with this way can respond telepathically if they choose.\nDrawback: You have sonic weakness 5. Additionally, whenever you take sonic damage, you are dazed until the end of your next turn."

    "description": "Maybe you were bitten as a child, or maybe it’s a family curse. Either way, you have a malady that is best not discussed in public, lest torches and pitchforks make an appearance.\nBenefit: Whenever you make a non-minion creature winded or kill a non-minion creature, you gain 1 surge.\nDrawback: At the start of each of your turns, if you have five or more surges—or one or more surges while in moonlight—you lose all your surges and become a wolfish hybrid until the end of your turn. While in that form, you have your usual statistics, but you must make a melee free strike against the nearest creature if you can. You can shift up to your speed toward that creature if necessary. If allies and enemies are equally near, you target an ally.\nSpecial: You can’t take this complication if you are a fury with the stormwight primordial aspect."

    "description": "An evil fairy cursed you, leaving you with a blank visage instead of a face. Although you’re able to imitate other peoples’ features, you’d like to have your own back.\nBenefit: You can spend 5 uninterrupted minutes to rearrange your face to resemble the face of another creature of your ancestry who you’ve observed before. You have a double edge on tests made to impersonate that creature or to disguise your identity. You are unable to change your hair or other nonfacial features.\nDrawback: Whenever you take damage, your face becomes blank, with no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears. This doesn’t affect your senses or your ability to speak. Your face doesn’t return until you use the benefit of this complication to restore it."

This trinket functions only while the total of your level plus your Victories is 5 or higher.

The voice seems to be aware of your surroundings, and its advice is usually vague but helpful. Someday its motivations might be different from your own, but for now, the voice seems keen on making sure you survive.\nDrawback: Eventually, the voice reveals it wants something from you that you might not want to provide.
